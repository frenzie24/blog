This is a project demonstrating how javascript can be used to manipulate the dom and storing data between sessions

## How do we demonstrate storing data?
We accomplish this by having users enter their username, title of the post, and the text content of their comment on a form.  
When the user submits we validate their data and store it in localStorage.  If data is not valid the user is prompted to re-enter data.
